# Capacitive-Torque-Sensor
This project focuses on the design and development of a Capacitive Torque Sensor system aimed at accurately measuring torque using capacitive sensing technology.
The system includes custom sensor hardware, signal processing electronics, and embedded firmware to convert capacitance variations into torque readings. The goal is to deliver a low-cost, high-resolution, and compact torque measurement solution for research and industrial applications, particularly where traditional strain gauge-based sensors are less effective.
